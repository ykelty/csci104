Problem 1
a) Unmodified
b) README.md is Modified and fun_problem.txt is Untracked
c) They are both staged
d) They are both modified
e) README.md is staged, funproblems.txt are untracked and the contents say "So far, so good"
f) The status of "Markdown is too easy" is staged because it was added 
but the status of "Fancy git move" is modified because it was just changed



Problem 2
a) Every action line in a makefile must start with a TAB
b) For "make clean", the destructors for shape1 and shape2 both get called. 
	For "make shape1", it compiles both shape1.o and shape.o.
c) The purpose of .PHONY is to say that the target is not a file.
d) Makefile and makefile are both acceptable names for a makefile.



Problem 3

1) a list of strings. It needs to be kept in chronological order
	 so it should be a list, and it'll store strings because it'll be the names of the teams.
2) a set of ints. There is no order and only one piece of data that we are storing so we will
	use a set. Also each value needs to be unique for efficient look up.
3) a map of strings as keys and sets of strings as values (map<string, set<string>>). We use a map
	because we need to map one set of values to another set of values and store them together.
4) a map of strings as keys and sets of ints as values (map<string, set<int>>). We need to map each
	state to a set of zipcodes.
5) a map of strings as keys and list of strings as values (map<string, list<string>>). We need to map
	each person to the list of donuts they want. We use a list instead of a set because we want to know
	how many of each type of donut a person gets.
