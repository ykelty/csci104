For Problem 4, I created an array that allowed me to look at specific elements in the input.

For Problem 5, I created two vectors in order to keep track of hastags and usernames.

For Problem 6, I created all the necessary funcions, constructors, and operators for the String class.
On Problem 6, I'm getting a warning for "*data = NULL" and was not able to figure out how to fix it.
